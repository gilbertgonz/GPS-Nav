# GPS-Nav
This ROS package was developed with the intent to provide GPS-waypoint based autonomous navigation for a landmine detecting AV. It consists of a GUI where the user can see the current location of the robot, location of detected landmines, input home and waypoint locations, and buttons that the user can utlize to control the robot.

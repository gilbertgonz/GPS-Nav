# GPS-Nav
This ROS package was developed with the intent to provide GPS-waypoint based autonomous navigation for a landmine detecting AV. It consists of a GUI where the user can see the current location of the robot, location of detected landmines, input waypoint locations, and buttons that the user can utlize to control the robot.
